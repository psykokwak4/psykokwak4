### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm ~~Xiaoquin~~ Xiaoqin (æ™“å‹¤)

<!--
**psykokwak4/psykokwak4** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- Chinese
- I'm a fast stackoverflow copy-paster
- It may not be straightforward to pronounce my first name in your native language, so feel free to auto-correct it as Xioqin, Xia, Xiaoquin, Shaw-Chin, Shaw, Xiaogin or use other creative variants!
- I'd like to work with: please, anything except powershell 
- unpopular opinion: python is more Ã©lÃ©gante compared to most of the scripting languages
- My WPM is about 86, and I'm an ESL speaker who loves making typos/grammar mistakes
- Email is my preferred method of communication. Shoot me an email if possible
- Vim, Emacs, sublime, vscode with Emacs keybindings: ðŸ¥°
- other system builtin default editors: ðŸ˜’

opinions are my own, of course
